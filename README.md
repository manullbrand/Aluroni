# Aluroni Restaurant

This restaurant web page prototype was developed during a TypeScript course (took in Alura's plataform).

## What I've learned:

- Create a project from scratch with **Create React App**
- How to use `normalize.css` to reset browser default styles
- Configure absolute imports to avoid importing files with multiple levels ('../../../')
- Learn good **CSS** practices such as creating variables, creating files for those variables, and using media query breakpoints
- Use the classnames package to use CSS modules without having to concatenate a bunch of CSS styles and deal with conditional styles.
- Learn how to use **SVGR**, a package that comes with Create React App, to import `svgs` as **React** components.
- Understand how React understands static imports, both via `.js` files and in style files such as `.scss` or `.css`.
- Learn how to import static files as variables via JS or using the public folder for dynamic imports of static files.

Showing here how you can select the restaurant's menu, for example:
